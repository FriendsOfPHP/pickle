Feature: convert package.xml to composer.json
  In order to use pickle on my package
  As an extension developer
  I should be able to create composer.json from my package.xml

  Background:
    Given a file named "package.xml" with:
      """
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <package packagerversion="1.4.7" version="2.0">
          <name>dummy</name>
          <providesextension>dummy</providesextension>
          <summary>This is a dummy package</summary>
          <version>
              <release>3.1.15</release>
              <api>3.1.0</api>
          </version>
          <stability>
              <release>beta</release>
              <api>stable</api>
          </stability>

          <notes>This is a note</notes>
          <changelog></changelog>
      </package>

    And a file named "config.m4" with:
