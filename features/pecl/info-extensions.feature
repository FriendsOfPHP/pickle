Feature: download and install PECL extensions
  In order to install PECL extensions
  As a pickle user
  I should be able to download and install PECL extensions

  Scenario Outline: Show info about downloaded extensions
    Given I run "pickle info <extension>@<version>"
    Then it should pass
    And the output should contain:
      """
      - Installing <extension> (<version>)
      """
    And the output should contain:
      """
      Downloading (100%)
      """
    And the output should contain:
      """
      Package name                      | <pretty>
      """
    And the output should contain:
      """
      Package version (current release) | <version>
      """

    Examples:
      | extension | pretty    | version  |
      | apc       | APC       | 3.1.13   |
      | apcu      | apcu      | 4.0.6    |
